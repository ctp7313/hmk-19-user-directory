## Description

Homework assignment learning to use React. Easily my favorite portion of the bootcamp! For this assignment, functionality is not 100%. I'm able to filter out users with the search bar by last name and can sort users by a chosen parameter and console log it. For some reason, can't get the table to populate again with the sorted data.
